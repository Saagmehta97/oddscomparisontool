# Odds Comparison Tool 

## What is this 
Current use of this tool compares FanDuel odds for NBA Basketball or MLB Baseball to Pinnacle Sportsbook Odds. Uses [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/) to retrieve this data. Find more favorable odds on FanDuel compared to a lower vig book like Pinnacle. 

## Future Considerations
1. Build Odds Screen using Flask. 
2. Implement other American Sportsbooks and compare the best odds to FanDuel.  
3. Implement Player Props (Potentially)
4. Create into recurring refresh live system (will require payment to The Odds API)
5. ***Derive Line History either by building out the structure yourself or getting it from the API endpoint (if possible).***
